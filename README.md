## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I was able to experiment with the Javascript HTML DOM. I was also able to create custom functions for my measurement conversions.

### Continued development

I'd love to dive even further into customizing CSS, the JavaScript DOM.
